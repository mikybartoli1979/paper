# Introduction
Booking.com is a dominant platform allowing consumers to find and compare hotel rooms.
The platform imposes Price Parity Clauses by which hotels commit to post the best price
on Booking.com (Wang and Wright, 2020). 
The issue has been studied also by Ivaldi et al (2020), Hunold et al. (2018) and Cazaubiel et al. (2019). 
Price parity clauses can have an anticompetitive effects. 
New and more efficient OTAs cannot be competitive, 
as Booking.com always gets the lowest price for a hotel room.

#Simulations
We simulate the impact of price parity clauses on hotel prices on
Booking.com, Expedia, and the hotels direct channel.

#Methodology
We use a D-in-D methodology (Angrist and Pischke, 2008) to evaluate the effect of 
banning price parity clauses in France, by focusing on prices of hotel in 
Corsica (France) and Sardinia (italy).

#Conclusions
We have made a fantastic new analysis of the elimination of price parity clauses.
Consumers and hotels gain from their elimination.
Nevertheless, data limitations do not allow to perform a full welfare analysis.
