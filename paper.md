# Introduction
Booking.com is a dominant platform allowing consumers to find and compare hotel rooms.
The platform imposes Price Parity Clauses by which hotels commit to post the best price
on Booking.com (Wang and Wright, 2020). 
The issue has been studied also by Ivaldi et al (2020), Hunold et al. (2018) and Cazaubiel et al. (2019). 
Price parity clauses can have an anticompetitive effects. 
New and more efficient OTAs cannot be competitive, 
as Booking.com always gets the lowest price for a hotel room.
